### Introduction
This is an end-to-end sports data analytics project focused on the T20 World Cup cricket data (2022 edition). The primary objective of this project is to gather insights and assemble the best 11 players team from Earth who can play against aliens. We have used web scraping, Python, pandas for data manipulation, and Power BI to create interactive dashboards for data visualization.
### Project Overview
In this project, we collected data from the ESPN Cricinfo website using the Bright Data web scraping tool. We then utilized Python and pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. The final step involved building interactive dashboards using Power BI to present our findings and create visualizations that help in assembling the best team.
### Usage
Obtain a Bright Data account and set up the necessary web scraping configuration to collect data from the ESPN Cricinfo website.
Run the Python scripts in the project to perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using pandas.
Use Power BI Desktop to open and explore the pre-built dashboard templates to visualize the cricket data.
### Data Collection
We used Bright Data web scraping to collect relevant data from the ESPN Cricinfo website. The data includes player statistics, team performance, match details, and other relevant information for the T20 World Cup 2022.
### Data Cleaning and Transformation
The collected data was processed and cleaned using Python and pandas. We handled missing values, formatted data, and performed necessary transformations to make it suitable for analysis.
### Data Analysis
Using pandas, we conducted various data analyses, including player performance, team strengths, historical trends, and other metrics to identify the best players for our dream team.
### Building Dashboards
We utilized Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. These dashboards showcase the insights gained from the data analysis and help in assembling the best 11 players to play against the aliens.
###  Conclusion
In this project, we successfully gathered data from the T20 World Cup 2022, performed data cleaning and transformation, analyzed player and team performance, and built interactive dashboards using Power BI. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to form the ultimate dream team to take on the aliens in an epic cricket match!
